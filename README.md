Project Name : Data analysis for YELP reviews
We are embarking on a comprehensive data analysis project utilizing the PostgreSQL database management system, featuring Yelp database with 4 json files. 
Data found at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset


The data isin the form of json files with folling types of info:
1. json_business: business information(name, reviews for the business, address, rating(out of 5) etc.
2. json_reviews: reviews text, rating, date of rating etc,
3. json_tip: user_id, business_id, date, compliment_count, etc.
4. json_user: user info(user name, friends, number of reviews) etc.


Scope of project:
• Leveraging cloud hosting for the PostgreSQL database offers several advantages, including scalability, reliability, and accessibility. Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure provide robust infrastructure for hosting databases, ensuring high availability.
• The primary objective of the data analysis project is to extract actionable insights from the rental database. These insights may include:
- Analyzing rental patterns over time (seasonal trends, peak hours/days)
- Understanding customer demographics and preferences
- Optimizing inventory management (ensuring sufficient copies of popular films)
- Discovering opportunities for upselling or cross-selling additional services
• We shall perform SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
• Statistical analysis to identify correlations and trends.
• Data visualization techniques (charts, graphs, dashboards) for presenting insights.
• Machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and customer segmentation.
• Integration with business intelligence (BI) platforms for advanced analytics and reporting.
By utilizing PostgreSQL and leveraging cloud hosting, we aim to conduct insightful data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable insights that can optimize operational
efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and drive strategic decision-making within the DVD rental industry.
